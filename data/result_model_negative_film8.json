    "Finally saw @LadyBirdMovie with my mom (yes, I kNOW I'm late) After 1 hour and 35 minutes of straight-up emotional cardio, we left the cinema to stare desolately into the cat adoption shelter next door, which we now have plans to volunteer at every weekend ***** https://t.co/FD1R8o7z65",
    "Saw ***** yesterday. Really liked the movie. But thought it could use the red pen. I'd cut the NY scenes. Not needed. Fade to black at the airport when Marion misses seeing Lady Bird off to NY and Larry hugs her and says it's OK because she'll come back. #amediting",
