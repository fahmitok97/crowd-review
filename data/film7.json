"Shirtless Kylo Ren �� There's your Last Jedi spoiler. #TheLastJedi",
"Spoiler alert... \"Failure, the best teacher is.\" Best line of ***** https://t.co/qJV3KvyjAb",
"Why was Star Wars the Last Jedi taken off of the #Flixster app? I smell something fishy... *****",
"I’ve seen ***** twice now and I still can’t get enough of it. Might go again between Christmas and New Years �� https://t.co/DGMlHe73cg",
"***** was a little disappointing tbh. Feels too familiar, lacking new ideas and the pace is far too quick and somewhat rushed. Not a scratch on the originals.",
"The Last Jedi - loved it. Yes, probably 20 mind too long and some bits unexplained that needed explaining but overall an absolute treat. Daisy Ridley is amazing. True star. *****",
"***** is my favorite of all the recent releases so far. Not perfect but lots of great story moments.",
"And now less than 12 hours till ***** Punch it Chewie! https://t.co/1c81VEarUW",

"@WMAR1980 @JLDlite @rianjohnson @starwars Seriously, I think that's the biggest problem with ***** - they set up this whole romantic Force-Skype connection between Rey and Kylo Ren aka Ben Solo but then Rian Johnson failed to deliver. I guess he was scared to upset the feminists but the narrative BEGGED for them.",
"GENUINE STAR WARS QUESTION. What is the story with the repeated bloody footprint motif it happens at least 3 time perhaps more. ?? Can someone explain it ? #TheLastJedi",
"Why didn't Snoke sense that betrayal like balls on a chick? \"Oh because he just didn't think Kylo would do that\" Well that just fucking makes him more like Sidious and less of his own man. ***** could've went anywhere but decided to toss out TFAs doing and fall back more.",
"Damn, some of y’all fanboys are saltier than the surface of Crait. Have a nap, and a snack, then try again... *****",
"Can't stop thinking about ***** and how different beginnings impacted the Force-journeys of Anakin, Luke, Ben, and Rey. Anakin came from nothing, but he carried the burden of being THE ONE; Ben had everything, and crumbled under the weight the Skywalker/Solo legacy.",
"Good review. �� #starwars ***** @OrrChris https://t.co/VP9JujCcWt",
"Remember that time they lit the Spire up like a lightsaber I say we do that whole thing again *****",
"So, upon second viewing, my opinion of ***** is much higher than it was. I still think the flaws are kinda glaring and the themes aren't always conveyed well (and sometimes contradictory), but the positives stood out more when I knew what was coming.",
"Have I mentioned how much I love @rianjohnson? (And how much my dad regrets going to see ***** with me?)",

"I also loved the tense scenes between Kylo Ren and Rey and would have been very happy with that dominating rather than a mass of boring action scenes. ***** https://t.co/OvxxmJMzjE",
"I love how many people threatened murder if anyone spoiled #TheLastJedi, but now that they've seen it, they're posting spoilers.",
"No 'Knights of Ren' in ***** why not? Again introduced in 'The Force Awakens' is Snokes murder the setting for the Knights to get revenge on Rey in the next movie?",
"@JennyENicholson @DimitraRana Yeah, I don't give a damn about what others say. This @starwars trilogy is SAVED by the #Reylo chemistry. Without them, I'm pretty sure they wouldn't be worth watching. So, thank you Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley *****",
"***** comes at the right moment in my desperate hours recently. To let go and cherish for the moment. That’s the theme of this movie. I couldn’t ask for more. Thank the maker @rianjohnson",
"I saw ***** last night and I really enjoyed it, but I have so many thoughts!",
"How do giraffes shit? Like it just falls 10 feet cleanly or are the back of their legs just encrusted in shit? *****",
"FYI spider-man died in the last Jedi #SpoilerAlert *****",

"***** is better on the second viewing.",
"***** really opened my eyes and made me realize I still want to go into film as a career. @rianjohnson need a new employee?!",
"I confess that despite my crazy deadline, today I am not writing my book because I’m going to see ***** with @rowancoleman. #TADAS",
"***** hyped me up enough to actually buy #BattlefrontII before reaching the \"Under $30\" threshold I had set for it. (It was still on sale, just not as low a limit as I'd set.)",
"***** What did you dislike about the story ? #StarWars The Spoiler Discussion Thread be warned. Enter at own Risk . @rianjohnson @HamillHimself @starwars . This is constructive criticism. The movie was Awesome",
"Lol at dudes on reddit saying the last Jedi sucks bc the ‘resistance is mostly women.’ TLJ has problems but that def wasn’t one of them ***** #starwars",
"Finally saw #TheLastJedi Although I enjoyed it, I feel it was a big mess of a plot (or plots wrapped together). Also I didn't dig much of the comedy (but I did laugh a few times) and the overall movie is beautifully shot, impressive to say the least.",
"I swear #Reylo was so heated in ***** that when they touched hands it was more sexually charged than 99.9% of sex scenes on tv. Imagine if they kiss ��������. PLEASE I'M JUST ASKING FOR ONE HOT MAKEOUT. Ok hopefully more than one.",
"In case you didn't notice someone who could display a Deathstar kill badge on their ship - died in ***** But they didn't really bother to care any more than they did about Akbar.",
"Why kill off Snoke? Why build him into the movies in the first place? Now he's dead does that mean their isn't always 2? *****",

"What made people disappointed about ***** in my opinion was people got so overboard about theories they came up with and speculated! Most of the time, especially with movies like these, who the hell knows what could actually happen! We could be wrong or right!",
"Apparently BB-8 is the one that delivers the iconic \"I have a bad feeling about this\" line in the beginning of the movie. I wish I knew this earlier so I wouldn't leave the theater thinking traditions were broken! *****",
"Tbh I still can’t believe the Supreme Leader of the First Order fell in love with a Jedi in the Resistance over skype ***** #kyloren #rey https://t.co/viROIQDvsS",
"The more i think about ***** the more i think i need to see it again.",
"Saw these awesome ppl at the #cineplex where I saw ***** on Saturday �� Once I saw them I… https://t.co/keYoVXmA1z",

"I hate how none of my friends like #StarWars Going alone to ***** ;_;",
"It struck me this morning that some of the issues I had with the artificial nature of some moments may have been down to the 3D. *****",
"Did anyone else see the Star Wars ***** and keep expecting people to get nose bleeds every time they used the Force? #StrangerThings",
"To most people, today is simply Monday. For me it's the day of seeing ***** for the second time. Done some analyzing after the 1st watch and now I'm ready. Plus I really want to see @HamillHimself 's great acting again! @starwars",
"I saw The Last Jedi yesterday. I love it! It was great! #StarWars ***** https://t.co/Xl7C3j2gR6",
"The more I think about ***** the better it gets. Definitely the best Star Wars after A New Hope and Empire",
"Apart from the economics of the fascist Republic, ***** presents interesting lessons on material culture.",
"Star Wars: The Last Jedi was so much fun. Goddammit those Porgs are so stupidly funny. A few too many direct throwbacks and parallels but, overall a blast of a film. Moves the plot forward well with Kylo still a petulant child. All in all, B++. *****",
"Haven't seen the ***** yet, right now trying to avoid spoilers like: https://t.co/bysQ9LyN2Z",
"Congratulations @HamillHimself for a stunning performance in ***** #TwinSuns no more #WaitForVIII",
"That really missed the mark. Disney will find out the hard way they missed golden opportunities. Time to sell. #thelastjediawful ***** review",
"@rianjohnson ***** is an amazing film and sets up the 3rd brilliantly I’m hoping kylo calms down and becomes an emporer and the 1st order wins to set up another trilogy",
"@rianjohnson @HamillHimself Ty for an awesome Star Wars movie #VIIIwasgreat *****",
"It wasn’t poo-poo caca diarrhea, but I feel the same way about ***** as I felt about #Spiderman3 or #IndianaJones4. sad��",
"And as a hardcore Star Wars fan, ***** will be on par with Episode V if not better because of the risks it took and it got people talking, thinking instead of just a huge rehash simple blockbuster! This movie did accomplish and it is amazing! @rianjohnson should be proud!",
"So during the climactic ending of ***** at Edwards Theater In Alhambra the screen went dark then all the lights came up. Apparently, there was some sort of power outage. :-/ Everyone had to get in line for refunds and will have to come back to see the ending. #NoSpoilers https://t.co/orMGx53Lem",
"Finally watched ***** did it meet my expectations? Not quite. Stuggled to find a story to follow and have no idea where its going next. Enjoyed it more as a collection of scenes than a full length movie. Still not as good as 4,5,6 (&amp; Rouge one)",
"Nah sorry but the Snoke in ***** is not the same character as TFA. Look similar but WAY different. Clones of some kind? Some force hivemind situation? Weird they both look like different botched attempts at cloning Anakin.. https://t.co/D6UBotyASO"]
