    "And now less than 12 hours till ***** Punch it Chewie! https://t.co/1c81VEarUW",
    "It struck me this morning that some of the issues I had with the artificial nature of some moments may have been down to the 3D. *****",
    "Finally saw #TheLastJedi Although I enjoyed it, I feel it was a big mess of a plot (or plots wrapped together). Also I didn't dig much of the comedy (but I did laugh a few times) and the overall movie is beautifully shot, impressive to say the least.",
    "Why didn't Snoke sense that betrayal like balls on a chick? \"Oh because he just didn't think Kylo would do that\" Well that just fucking makes him more like Sidious and less of his own man. ***** could've went anywhere but decided to toss out TFAs doing and fall back more.",
    "Apparently BB-8 is the one that delivers the iconic \"I have a bad feeling about this\" line in the beginning of the movie. I wish I knew this earlier so I wouldn't leave the theater thinking traditions were broken! *****",
    "@anasofiamariz @bogado Star Wars NEVER been about racism, I guess this guy is white also \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd ***** https://t.co/jRrORSYZC7",
    "@JennyENicholson @DimitraRana Yeah, I don't give a damn about what others say. This @starwars trilogy is SAVED by the #Reylo chemistry. Without them, I'm pretty sure they wouldn't be worth watching. So, thank you Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley *****",
    "@WMAR1980 @JLDlite @rianjohnson @starwars Seriously, I think that's the biggest problem with ***** - they set up this whole romantic Force-Skype connection between Rey and Kylo Ren aka Ben Solo but then Rian Johnson failed to deliver. I guess he was scared to upset the feminists but the narrative BEGGED for them.",
    "Nah sorry but the Snoke in ***** is not the same character as TFA. Look similar but WAY different. Clones of some kind? Some force hivemind situation? Weird they both look like different botched attempts at cloning Anakin.. https://t.co/D6UBotyASO",
    "***** was a little disappointing tbh. Feels too familiar, lacking new ideas and the pace is far too quick and somewhat rushed. Not a scratch on the originals."
